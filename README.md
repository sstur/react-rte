# React Rich Text Editor

This is a forked version of react-rte#image-support(by sstur).
I'll remove this package if original package adopts image-support feature.
[Original Package](https://github.com/sstur/react-rte)

## Getting Started

    $ npm install --save react-rte-image

## Run the Demo
Clone this project. Run `npm install`. Run `npm run build-dist` then point the server of your choice (like [serv][serv]) to `/demo.html`.
